## Personal Profile

### Work History

I have been engaged in front-end for 7 years, graduated when vue2 was popular, attracted by vue2's simple and efficient interface implementation, and switched from Java to front-end development.
Started to enter an industrial Internet of Things company, began the visualization of the journey, real-time display of real-time display of vehicle action scenes in the factory feel a sense of accomplishment, and then entered the restaurant robotics unicorn.
After that, I entered a food and beverage robotics unicorn company, and saw a more detailed and perfect way of real-time scene realization, and refined my skills.
Later on, I worked in a medical imaging company, where I saw a variety of scenarios where canvas was applicable and learned some knowledge related to 3D images.

### Technology Stack

In addition to the basic front-end frameworks vue and react, I mainly focus on graphic images, such as echarts, fabric, pixi, zrender, all of which I have used in depth.
I don't have any experience in 3D related projects, but I have touched webgl, and I have seen a lot of projects implemented in three, so I don't have any problem to start doing it. I've also written electron, which is a real-time screen display for industrial robots.
I've also written electron, which displays real-time information on the screen of an industrial robot, and I've written react native, which is an app biography project for someone else.

### Personal Thoughts

I built this website because I want to have a platform to show myself and do some learning summaries and tips. Tentatively, I will write some canvas-related content and web3 learning-related stuff.

### Planned Outlook

I'm learning web3 and foreign full-stack technology due to various factors, and I hope to become a remote developer and have my own products and IPs.
